## ⏱️ Performance

_Note: The following results were benchmarked on FP16 engines inside ComfyUI, using 2000 frames consisting of 2 alternating similar frames, averaged 2-3 times_

| Device | Rife Engine | Resolution| Multiplier | FPS |
| :----: | :-: | :-: | :-: | :-: |
|  H100  | rife49_ensemble_True_scale_1_sim | 512 x 512  | 2 | 45 |
|  H100  | rife49_ensemble_True_scale_1_sim | 512 x 512  | 4 | 57 |
|  H100  | rife49_ensemble_True_scale_1_sim | 1280 x 1280  | 2 | 21 |

## 🚀 Installation

Navigate to the ComfyUI `/custom_nodes` directory

```bash
git clone https://github.com/yuvraj108c/ComfyUI-Rife-Tensorrt
cd ./ComfyUI-Rife-Tensorrt
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

### ⚠️ Installation Issues (CUDA Versions)
This node defaults to **CUDA 12** libraries (`requirements.txt`).
If you are using **CUDA 13**, or if you experience dependency errors, please install the specific requirements file for your system:

**For CUDA 13:**
```bash
pip install -r requirements_cu13.txt
```

**For CUDA 12 (Default):**
```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

This ensures the correct `tensorrt-libs` and `tensorrt-bindings` are installed to match your system.

The following RIFE models are supported and will be automatically downloaded and built:
   - **rife49_ensemble_True_scale_1_sim** (default) - Latest and most accurate
   - **rife48_ensemble_True_scale_1_sim** - Good balance of speed and quality
   - **rife47_ensemble_True_scale_1_sim** - Fastest option

Models are automatically downloaded from [HuggingFace](https://huggingface.co/yuvraj108c/rife-onnx) and TensorRT engines are built on first use.

## ☀️ Usage

1. **Load Model**: Insert `Right Click -> Add Node -> tensorrt -> Load Rife Tensorrt Model`
   - Choose your preferred RIFE model (rife47, rife48, or rife49)
   - Select precision (fp16 recommended for speed, fp32 for maximum accuracy)
   - The model will be automatically downloaded and TensorRT engine built on first use

2. **Process Frames**: Insert `Right Click -> Add Node -> tensorrt -> Rife Tensorrt`
   - Connect the loaded model from step 1
   - Input your video frames
   - Configure interpolation settings (multiplier, CUDA graph, etc.)
   - Image resolutions between `256x256` and `3840x3840` are supported 

## 🤖 Environment tested

- WSL Ubuntu 24.04.03 LTS, Cuda 12.9, Tensorrt 10.13.3.9, Python 3.12.11, RTX 5080 GPU
- Windows (Not tested, but should work)

## 🚨 Updates

### December 2025
- **Automatic Model Management**: No more manual downloads! Models are automatically downloaded from HuggingFace and TensorRT engines are built on demand
- **Improved Workflow**: New two-node system with `Load Rife Tensorrt Model` + `Rife Tensorrt` for better organization
- **Updated Dependencies**: TensorRT updated to 10.13.3.9 for better performance and compatibility
